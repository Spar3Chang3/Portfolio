    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="summary">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Ever since I was a kid, I'd dreamed of working with computers. Phones, websites, data parsing, they're all actually interesting to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            OK, so that sounds a little weird to think someone WANTS to handle a bunch of data. But someone's got to do it! I believe in making things that are accessible to all parties, inclusive to all.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's where web design comes in. The web is such a dynamic, ever-updating platform, which is what gives it infinite flexibility. Don't believe me? Think about all the entirely web-based apps out there. Discord, Spotify, even Uber!
        </p>
        <p>
            And that's where I come in. Web design offers a platform of complete freedom with UI design, packaged in languages that every modern browser can understand. This lets me build you only the most tailored experience, with every component automatically fitting to nearly every screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            For 2 years now, I have been developing full stack applications that emphasize a brand's language. I'm a quick learner that picks up on frameworks within the week. And for the backend? I've been programming with Java since high school. So I can work with ol' reliable, or go modern with my latest forte into GoLang.
